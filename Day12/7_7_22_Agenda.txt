	Multithreading
	SOA using WCF
	asp.net security
		Authentication & Authorization

		Role based Security  Implementation in asp.net mvc application



Multithreading

	Application:
		  Exeuctable code
		  bin/debug/(.exe file or .dll file)-----Assembly
					Executable file------.exe
					Classlibrary---------.dll
		   contains set of instructions
						MSIL code

	Operating System has a kernel
		 IT uses some kernel objects
				PRocess, Thread,
				event, semaphore, mutex, etc.
	  
	Process: 
		IT act like a container
			keep all resources reserved which  needed for exeution of application
			Heap ( dynamic memory allocation)
			Code Segment
			Data Segment
			
		Passive Kernel Object
		Application under execution

	Thread:
		Active Kernel Objects
		a path of exeuction


		lightweight process

	Synchronization Kernel Objects

		event,Critical Secion, semaphore, mutex, etc.



	Hardware Devices:
		CPU--Central Processing Unit (MicroProcessor)---------------Computation
		RAM--Random Access Memory
				



	Application project is build in two modes
		debug mode------------contains executable code which can be used to trace runtime errors
				      with the help of debugger.

		release mode----------contains executable code which is to be deployed to customer side



Process:
	Every process created due  .net is multithreaded process.


	Main-------primary Thread
	GC---------Garbage Collector----Automatic memory managment



Why we use multithreading ?
			
	simultenious exeuction
	Executing tasks independently

	Efficient Utilization of CPU





Threadpool
	 Pool of Threads kept ready for execution
